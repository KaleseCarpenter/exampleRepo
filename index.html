       <h2>About Me</h2>

    </p>
</div>
 
<div id="div5">
    <p>
        I am from northern Ohio. <br><br>
        I enjoy going to live shows.<br><br>
        I want to travel for a living, own an organic farm and have a home right in front of the beach.<br><br> 
        It has always been a dream of mine to to learn coding languages so that I can develop apps and explore different avenues within music.<br><br>
        I originally got introduced to HTML from Myspace and it motivated me to go to college in San Francisco for Web Design and New Media.<br><br>
        I am on a journey to become my highest self. All I want to do from here on out is live within my purpose, film and edit more content, travel more, help save the earth, continue to collaborate with creators and make great lasting relationships with positive people.
